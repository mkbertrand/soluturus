# soluturus
Hi!
Soluturus is a symbolic algebra program designed to store expressions and perform operations with those expressions.  These expressions may be of known or unknown value and are able to have a flexible shape.  Soluturus does this by nesting classes that represent various forms.  All classes used to represent operations are immutable.
